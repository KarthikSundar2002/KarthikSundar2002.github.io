Hey Everyone,
Here, I would like to answer the most fundamental questions behind every initiative. They are

### Why am I doing this?

There is no grand philosphical idea behind all this. It is rather quite simple.
I want a system which satisfies the following criteria:
1. A system to make sure that I constantly challenge myself and improve myself.
2. A medium through which I can speak my thoughts and help others like me.
3. A medium which allows me to become an expert in a field of my choice.

This blog will make myself accountable to my readers. It will make sure that I continue to work towards my goals and not get distracted midway. After all, being accountable to someone is one of the best ways to make sure that you stick to the task. Thus, it satisfies the first criteria.

Obviously, this blog satisfies the second criteria as it exists on the internet and the fact that you are reading this line as of this moment is a proof that it satisfies the second criteria.

To explain how this blog satisfies the third criteria, I need to answer the next question.

### What is this about?

This blog is a record of my thoughts, my findings and my experiments to improve myself in four specific niches. The niches are as follows:
   1. **Health and Fitness**
   2. **Productivity**
   3. **Programming**


The first two niches are chosen to make better use of the two most important resources we have - our body and time.
Programming is the field in which I wish to become an expert. I hope by now you understand how it satisfies the third criteria.

### How I plan on doing it?

Before jumping into any experimentation, I will start with acquiring the necessary knowledge. Thus, the first post in any specific topic is going to be a post where I share the knowledge I acquired. This will be followed by a post where I put that knowledge into use. That is the basic structure of this blog.If you want to add or oppose anything in any of my blog posts, you are always welcomed to do so. It would mean a lot if you try out the experiments and give your feedback.

### Am I eligible to do so?
I am not an expert in any of the above niches. I am just an average guy who wants to improve himself. However, the fact that I am a beginner makes me eligible to write this blog. This blog is not a story of how I achieved my goals,instead it is a documentation of me trying to achieve them.

You can always approach me in any manner. If you have any suggestions for this blog, please contact me. I got nothing more to say.. I hope you enjoy your time here!
