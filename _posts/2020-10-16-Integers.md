As we have seen earlier, everything can be stored in the form of 0s and 1s which just says whether at a point inside, we have absence or presence of voltage.
In this post we see about how we represent a common data type called Integer.
There are two types of Integers

1. Unsigned Integers
2. Signed Integers

## Unsigned Integer

As the name says, this type does not denote the sign and only denotes the magnitude.
The method we go about representing numbers using unsigned integer data type is actually quite intuitive to us.
Let’s take a number like “31”,
![Unsigned Integers]({{"/public/images/Unsigned-Integers.png" | relative_url}})

Therefore for n places of a binary number , it can represent from 0 to 2^n - 1 integers.

## Signed Integers

Lets take “+125”, we have added a fourth place or character to denote the sign.
Similarly we can add a bit to denote the sign.

Let’s have 5-bits, so we have 2<sup> 5</sup> codes, so instead of representing 0 to 31 we can use 30 of them to assign +1 to +15 and -1 and -15. One for 0. This leaves us with one more bit, we will come to it later.
For positive numbers,if the leftmost digit is 0, we can just use the convention followed for unsigned integers.Thus, all positive numbers are started by 0.

Then comes the question of **negative numbers**?

For the first bit or the sign bit ,we can say that 1 will represent negative numbers, as 0 represents positive numbers. Let’s come to the remaining bits. The first intuitive thought is ,let’s follow the same convention as unsigned integers(This convention is called as signed magnitude).However, our predecessors wanted to come to a representation which would make the logical circuit as simple as possible

 One of most basic operations for a computer to perform is addition. You will come to know in the future posts that we have electronic structures called adders which will add binary in the following manner.

So as we all know when we add a number and it’s negative, we get 0, so we need to frame the negatives in a way such that we get 0. There are two ways in which we can get 0. One is to add two numbers so that we get just 00000. Then the other method is to add two numbers so that we get 100000, where the leftmost digit “1” is nothing but the bit which denotes the sign, so we can safely ignore it because *negative zero* and *positive zero* are both same.(Note: In a convention called 1's complement, there are different representations for +0 and -0. As 1's complement is not used widely, it's not covered in this series.)

Let’s take an example

Let’s take the number +7, it can be represented as 00111. Now, assume your are a computer, do you think it’s possible for you to generate 00000(“without the carry”).

It’s impossible, because the computer knows only to *add*. So, the only way for us to get a 0 is to generate 100000.

Now here’s where the tricky part is, we can’t get much of an idea, when we go about generating 100000. So let’s step it down a notch. What’s the closest number to 100000 and less than it?

It’s 11111.

Now if we can think of a way to generate 11111, then we can just use that method and add 1 to generate 100000.

Now think of how to generate a 1?

We can generate a 1 by adding a 0 to 1 or vice versa. In switch analogy, 1 is ON and 0 is OFF, so we can consider this as adding a bit to *a bit which is made by flipping the switch*. The technical name for this is adding a bit to it’s complement bit.

Now we know how to generate a 1, so to generate 11111, we need to add the binary number to it’s complement(the binary number made by *flipping* all it's bits). Then to generate 100000 or 00000, we need to add 00001 to 11111.

Thus we can say that, to find the negative representation of number A, add 1 to the complement of A.


![Complement and it's equivalence to negative]({{"/public/images/Complement-and-negative.png" | relative_url}})

Now we have only one problem left to solve with respect to integers, i.e we had 32 codes and we have allotted 31 of them. That one code is 10000. From the starting digit 1, we can say it’s a negative number. We know that the least negative number in the numbers allotted is -15, which is 10001. So 10000, is a 1 subtracted from -15, so it’s -16. This convention is called as 2’s complement.

## Range of Integer Data Type

Generally, integer data type is given 4 bytes of storage which is 32 bits of storage ( 1 byte - 8 bits) So the usual range of integer data type is -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,648. Some systems also allot 2 bytes i.e 16 bits , their range is -32,768 to 32,767.

That’s it for today’s post. In the next post, we will see some more representations of data.
