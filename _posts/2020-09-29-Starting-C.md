![C Programming]({{"/public/images/2542771_af5d_4.jpg" | relative_url}})

I stumbled upon programming through Game Development. From there, I went to learn the basics of HTML and CSS, the basics of python. During this time, I have always stayed away from C and C++. They have a steep learning curve, and to be realistic, you don’t use C or C++ to develop apps,games or websites.  I was able to make some games and websites but **I have always felt like my knowledge was shallow**.

## Why C
C and C++ can be called “The Mother of all other Programming Languages ”. All the modern languages are written in C and C++. I have “heard” (I am not 100% sure, because I have not personally learnt any computer-related theory, but I have heard from reliable sources so I am around 98% sure), it will help in learning the fundamental theories of computer science. If you want to know more about, you can find it [here](https://www.topcoder.com/5-reasons-keep-learning-c/).

### C or C++

The main difference is that C is a Procedural Programming Language, while C++ is a combination of both object-oriented and procedural programming language. However, what does these terms mean?

**Procedural Programming Language** - The Language is defined by algorithms and functions which in turn operates on the data. You program the raw instructions for a program to follow.

**Object-Oriented Programming Language**- The Language is based on the idea where we create objects which holds related data and procedures. We can get the required data wherever and whenever it is needed.

There are much more, however as a beginner I was not able to understand them completely. If you are interested, you can find them [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-c-and-c/). I plan on making myself familiar with the procedural side before I leap on to take the Object-Oriented Side.

## Learning C

I have looked at several resources but I enjoyed learning from this: [C Programming Tutorial](https://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/c-tutorial.html?inl=nv)  (!Kudos to the creator for keeping such a polished course free).

Note: It is not necessary for you to read the whole thing before you start to code. It is better if you code and practice along the way. A good form of practice is Competitive Programming. More about that in the next post.
