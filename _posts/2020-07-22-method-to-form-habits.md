## Goal

To find a system or an sequence of processes which will ensure that I stick to an habit.

## My Story
<br>
### Why I chose this experiment?

When I was writing this, I was a student preparing for his college entrance exams. Earlier, in the pre-COVID era, I was able to concentrate on my studies as there was a definite deadline and there was many people to watch over me. However, as COVID came into the picture, schools got shut-down and the exams did not have definite deadlines anymore, which lead me to drifting off.  Thus I want to make the act of deep focused study a habit.

### Background Knowledge

Before diving in, I have to equip myself with all the necessary knowledge needed to help me succeed in the experiment.

#### How do Habits Form

Habits follows a 4-step cycle. To follow along, let us take the habit of checking our social media messages and feeds

##### Cue

​	It is the trigger for the action.  There are 5 types of cue. They are as follows:<br>
      - Time: Habits which are triggered by the time. Brushing is a common example.<br>
  		- Location: Habits which are triggered by the place we are in. The reason behind the fact that studying in a classroom is easier than to study at home. Fast-Food joints use this cue efficiently. They make sure from every point in the city, there will be a close fast-food joint available. They also make sure all of their joints look nearly the same and taste the same. Thus, giving us the cues and rewards.
  		 <br>- Previously Occurred Events:  Habits  can be triggered by a event which occurred earlier. Our scenario falls into this category. Our cue is the buzzing notification we get in our mobile.
  	<br>	- Emotional State:  The mood we are in also acts as a cue. Our case may very well fall also into this category, we may have the habit of going through our feeds whenever we feel bored. We may have habit of eating whenever we feel stressed.
  	<br>	- People: As humans are social animals, the role of other people on your habits should not be surprising to you. This is the reason behind the advice “You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with”.

##### Craving

​	It is the anticipation of the reward. This step comes into play only after many repetitions of the same habit. This is actually a replica of the same sensation we feel after the completion of habit. Let us come to our example, we humans are naturally attracted to attention. We love it when someone listens to us. Whenever we get a social media notification, our attention-seeking characters come into play and therefore we feel happy, when someone sends us a message, or someone likes a picture you posted or commented to it. Thus, whenever we hear a notification sound on our mobile, our craving for the attention kicks in.

##### Response

​	It is the act of us doing the habit. In our scenario, it will be the act of us going to our social media feeds

##### Reward

​	It is the end result of the habit. If the reward is accompanied with the release of chemicals such as Endorphins, Dopamine, Serotonin and Oxytocin (Chemicals responsible for your happiness), the cycle will become an habit. In our example, the attention we get, is the reward.

​However,You may complain I don’t feel any kind of happiness even after an hour of mindless scrolling through your Instagram feed. On the day you created an account in Instagram, you would have obviously felt some kind of happiness. Initially, every single follower you get will make you experience a rush of serotonin (the chemical which is responsible for you feeling a sense of importance). However, after some repeated and continuous dose of serotonin, your receptors adapt to your new and high level of serotonin levels, making it the new normal. Now, when you eventually reach a plateau, you start to crave for the attention you got earlier. This leads you to scroll through your feeds in the hopes you will get the reward you got earlier.

(Note: Don’t get me wrong, I am in no way against the idea of social media. However, too much of anything even Oxygen is dangerous. In fact, I support the concept of  forming an community of like-minded people through social media. I also support the fact that social media has changed the whole marketing industry and it has helped millions bring their business to the next level)



### The Experiment

​	Now equipped with necessary knowledge, I start my experiment. There is a major difference between forming a new habit and changing your current habits. This post is aimed at forming a new habit. If you want to break a bad habit, make sure not to change the reward and if possible the cues.

#### Deciding on the Reward

​	So, I want to have a reward which should appeal me. This is a personal choice, so there aren’t any guidelines. Ideally, your reward should be a sort of sensation, as they are the most-consistent reward you can rely on. You don’t need to worry about becoming dependent on the reward. The increase in dopamine levels produced by alcohol and other addictive substances is far more greater than that produced by a sense of accomplishment.

​	I decided that I will track the number of hours of deep study sessions I put everyday. Eventually, this will help in getting a sense of an accomplishment. Hopefully, my scores in my practice tests will also serve the same purpose. Initially, I decided that for every 2 hours of study , I will allow myself to watch 25 minutes of anime. (I am quite into Anime, so I believe it will work for me) . I also keep a journal where I make note of all the completed tasks.

#### Downscaling My Habit

​	This is also called the two minute rule. It says, you want your habit to be completed within 2 minutes. However, I can’t study much if I studied only for 2 minutes. Thus I want a habit which will start a chain reaction and make me to study for the next 2 hours. Therefore I try to downscale my desired habit.

When starting each of my study session,I start a timer and keep my mobile outside the room. I take the required question bank (A book with problems separated topic-wise) for the respective subject and work on the first, incomplete problem you see, in the desired chapter. This is the habit. Usually, the questions I select will be tough and It will make me to work for the next crucial 5 minutes  (during which we are the most vulnerable to distractions). After which, I will probably spend a good amount of time of solving problems. If I want to learn a concept, I will move on to them after I solve the first problem.

The aim behind this step is to make the process of starting out as effortless as possible. We want to make sure that we do the easy thing everyday so eventually we can build up our habit to our desired level.

#### Reduce the Friction

Unlike the motivational pictures you see on the internet, willpower is not an infinite resource. It is actually limited. We have a limited amount of willpower and we exhaust it whenever we resist our temptations. This process is actually termed as ego-depletion. This limited resource is replenished whenever we take a good meal (especially  good amount of glucose ) or a deep sleep. This is also the reason behind the late-night commercials. In the night, people will be extremely tired and they their will-power will be exhausted. Thus, they are not in a state where they can resist the temptation to buy a product or to make good decisions about the necessity of the product.

Thus, I want to minimize the amount of distractions in my study space. Therefore, I plan on keeping my mobile and my laptop outside my room. I will take my laptop inside only when I need to attend some class, attend a online practice test or refer something.

I keep all my books nearby so I don’t need to wander around. I also keep some stationaries and a water bottle nearby.

#### Finding a Cue

In this step we need to find a good cue, which will make us feel the need to do the desired habit. Like If you want to learn guitar, keep it in a stand and keep the stand in a visible spot in your room. This will make sure that you get the craving to play it whenever you see it. However, this doesn’t work in my case because the sight of my textbooks doesn’t make me to study them. I ended up with a different cue. I write down all the tasks in a journal and I cross them whenever they are completed. The sight of open-tasks makes me to crave for a sense of accomplishment which I will receive after I complete the task.

#### Separate Your Habits by Location

This works on the principle of Cue. In my study space, I am going to only study. If I wanted a break, I am going to get-up and go to another room to relax. This is quite straight-forward.



I have planned out the complete experiment. The only thing left is to observe what happens overtime.

### Observations
