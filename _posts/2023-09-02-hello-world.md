title: Hello World!
---

Hello There, I am Karthik Sundar, a final year student pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Communication Engineering. I am based in India and I study at the National Institute of Technology,Tiruchirapalli. This is just a place for my thoughts and ideas and over time I hope it serves as a documentation of my life.

After some thought, I decided to pursue Graduate Studies, instead of getting a job. I have shortlisted some universities in the US. I have my TOEFL in 8 days. I have to prepare for it but yeah, can't bring myself to do so. I have also registered for the GRE, and it is on 28th September. I have to prepare for that as well. I like to code and build cool stuff and also to make cool artwork using software such as Blender, Photoshop, and After Effects. I used to read a lot of books back in middle school, however somewhere along the way, I stopped doing so. I decided to pick it up again. As of now, I am reading three books:
    1. The Pathless Path by Paul Millard
    2. How to Not Die Alone by Logan Ury
    3. Book Lovers by Emily Henry
Once I finish these, I will write about how I feel about them, but so far, they're good. Oh shit, I forgot that I have a few tests in the courses I am taking this semester.
Thanks for reading through my ramblings.
