(Disclaimer: I am not an expert, I am also a newbie. The following is what I learnt in the process of starting it.)

### What is Competitive Programming

It is a competition or a sport where the goal is to write a program to solve some problems.

### Why Competitive Programming

If you like to solve problems, then competitive programming is for you. However even if you don’t like to solve problems, competitive programming will help you practice algorithms and will make you a better coder. Competitive programming also plays a role in interviews and job placements.

## How to start Competitive Programming

Before you proceed, make sure that you are familiar with a programming language(preferably C,C++ or Java), If you want to know how to start learning C, you can check it [here](https://kodersdiary.com/Starting-C).

After you become familiar with the basics of the language,you need to check for online platforms like [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) ,[Topcoder](https://www.topcoder.com/community/competitive-programming/), [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/) , [SPOJ](https://www.spoj.com/ ) and more. These platforms are places where fellow developers like us pit our heads against each other in competitions. They also provide a large number of practice problems.

I will show here how to start with Codeforces.

1. Go to the [website](https://codeforces.com/), and register using the link on the top right.

2. After signing in, proceed to the section named “Problemset”.

3. Here if you click on the tick mark in the table, the problems will sorted in the decreasing number of correct submissions.

   ​	You will most likely see the following problem:
   ![Watermelon-Problem]({{"/public/images/Watermelon-Problem.png" | relative_url}})

   ​	(Hint: Write down the few cases from the beginning, then you will get the idea.)

4. Now you can start practicing your skills.

Enjoy!
