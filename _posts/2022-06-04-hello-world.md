title: Hello World!

Hey There, I want this blog to be a place where I document my weekly progress on my projects. However, it will also have a glimpse of other parts of my life.  

At the moment, I am working on  
- I got selected as a GSoC'22 Contributor. I will be working with CERN and to be specific with the team of Reva and CERNBox. The project I will be working on is to implement an OCM Webdav Service which allows several users spanning across different organizations to effectively sync and share data.
- I am also working at a company called GMetri. I have been there for a month by now.
- I just completed my second year in my college. I am not sure about other countries, but in India, software companies will be having their campus interviews regarding 2023 summer internships around the month of August. I need to start preparing for that.
- I am also a part of my college's design club. I have to work on a 3d artwork for the club. I need to get this done by June 15.
- Few of my peeps and I are working on a startup idea. I have to design a logo for it, and I have to work on the development of the app. More on the startup later.  

Hope I don't procrastinate :),  

See ya
