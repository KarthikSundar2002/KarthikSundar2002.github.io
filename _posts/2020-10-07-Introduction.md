We have come a long way since the start of Computers.Our predecessors have made our lives a lot more simpler by abstracting the essence of the underlying workings of the computers in the form of programming languages such as C , C++ , Java and etc.
This Abstraction is a blessing,when the things go as expected. If things go off the track,then a good understanding of the underlying working is needed.
This series hopes to achieve that. It may takes months to complete the series, but I feel it's worth it. We will start with the most fundamental operation in the computer - the flow of electrons, then hopefully go all the way to the beginning of C-Programming.
Enjoy!!
