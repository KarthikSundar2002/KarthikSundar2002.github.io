Hey Everyone,
Here, I would like to answer the most fundamental questions behind every initiative. They are

>  Why am I doing this? <br>
>  What is this about? <br>
>  How I plan on doing it?


### Why am I doing this?

There is no grand philosphical idea behind all this. It is rather quite simple.
The criteria is as follows:
1. I want a system to make sure that I constantly challenge myself and improve myself.
2. I want a medium through which I can speak my thoughts and help others like me.
3. This medium or system should give me the freedom to explore and branch out my knowledge.

This blog satisfies all the criteria. This blog will make myself accountable to my readers, which ensures that I always find ways to challenge myself and improve myself. If not, then there won't be any new posts in this blog, which means the readers won't get any more value out of this blog and this works like a visual indicator or a warning sign telling me to change.

Obviously, this blog satisfies the second criteria as it exists on the internet and the fact that you are reading this line as of this moment is a proof that it satisfies the second criteria.

This blog is based on the broad concept of self-improvement. Most of the things that people would like to learn will always play a role in self-improvement. Thus this blog can in fact be even a place where I can share every skill I learn and the process of me learning it. I believe this may serve as a roadmap for my readers who wish to learn the same skill.

### What is this about?

This blog is an record of all the experiments I conduct to improve myself. For clarity,the broad concept of self-improvement is categorized into six categories.
They are
 1.  <b>Health</b>
      - Aim: to become physically eligible for all kinds of activities and to be healthy
 2.  <b>Productivity</b>
      - Aim: to get the most value out of our limited and scarce time
 3.  <b>SkillSet</b>
      - Aim: to learn specific skills like Coding,Playing Guitar,Game-development, Pixel-art and so on
 4.  <b>Social Skills</b>
      - Aim: to foster good connections and move forward as a community
 5.  <b>Finance</b>
      - Aim: to manage my finances and be able to make sound financial decisions
 6.  <b>Style</b>
      - Aim: to make good decisions on how I want to present myself via my clothing and appearance.
