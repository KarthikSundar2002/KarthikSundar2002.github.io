Hey Everyone,
Here, I would like to answer the most fundamental questions behind every initiative. They are

>  What is this about?
>  Why am I doing this?

This blog is about how to excel at a game!

I am sure everyone would have played a game at least once... Whatever it is, I am quite sure it is not the best one out there. The best one is played by approximately 8 billion people....

Of course it is Minecraft!

Just Kidding!
The longest,oldest and the most difficult game is .....

### Workings of our game.

Each day have a time limit of 24 hours.At the start each player is given a specific set of characteristics. There may be some natural buffs or de-buffs(buffs mean some positive effect given to you, like being tall) given to you.  However, the buffs' effectiveness also depends on the manner you use it. In some cases buffs may also act against you. These buffs do play a role but your use of your 24 hours  everyday, plays a bigger role. The genetics or your buffs and de-buffs are quite out of our control. Thus, it's no use talking , worrying or bragging about it.

There is no definite end to this game. The end and duration of your playtime depends on many factors. For our purposes, let's say our playtime is around 100 years. Unlike other games, this game doesn't have a right or wrong way to play it. Each player decides how he/she plays it. When each player gets to the end of his/her game, a **dialog-box** is sure to pop up in their mind asking

> What are your last words?
>
> Would you like to change anything in your gameplay?

I want my answer to both of those questions to be:

>System, I have nothing to say. I have already  said everything I want to say.
>
>System, I feel I played this game the best way possible so I just want to take a good rest. Thank You!

Now you may or may not agree with my answers. However, If you are still reading this article, I am quite sure you will gain something from this blog.

There are some base rules, I set upon myself in playing this game.

Rule #1: You are accountable for whatever happens in your game.

Sometimes, you feel like you're not in control for what happens. Who the hell can predict an forest fire or a pandemic ? It is these things which make this game the most interesting. No one knows what is going to happen, and I feel that is how it should be ,because if we know it then it's going to be boring. However, we are always given the choice either to move on forward or to just keep complaining about it. Nothing is going to change by complaining. We all know that the creator of this game is a merciless jerk, but that jerk has also given us the ability to adapt and control how the game plays out.

Rule #2 : Each and every decision should be solely made by you, the player.

Peer Pressure and others' opinions should not disturb the opinions you have about you. The best way to change your opinion about yourself is through your actions, because after all you can't use cheat-codes to make yourself believe that you are great.

Rule #3 : You may not have a billion things..but you should always be grateful for what you do have

The fact that you are reading this article means you are a human, a player of this game. There are around 9 million species out of which only one is a playable species and all the remaining are NPCs(Non - Player Character). From the maths I know, it is a very slim chance to be born as a player.

Then let's get to the players of this game. As I told earlier, we are just going to concentrate on the things we can control. So in this game we have **Six Components** to each player.

They are:

1. **HP** - Hitpoints (Health and Fitness)
2. **CP** - Charm Points (Style and Appearance)
3. **Social Skills** - Social Interactions and Mindset
4. **Passive Skills** - Skills which do not take extra effort (Habits,Productive Systems and more)
5. **Active Skills** - Skills which take effort to do so and activates only when needed(Specific skills like Coding,Music,Art,Studying and et cetra)
6. **Business Skills -** Skills which help in business, finance.

Note: The Charm Points are gender-specific. I would like to give only personally verified tricks to excel in this game. As I am a Man,the tricks in CP section are applicable to Men.

This blog is a guide to play this game the best way possible. We got one chance to play so let us all do our best to play it the way we want it, because I am not sure there is a restart button for this game.

Now let's move on to second question,

## **Why am I doing this?**

It is quite simple. After all this is a research process, and research is based on collaboration. I try several things to improve my playstyle. I put them up here. I hope you find them useful and also try them out. You give your feedback about them. I tweak the processes a little.. and the process continues till the end of this game. That is the thing here, there is no definite treasure chest or certain task upon completion rewards happiness and satisfaction. Instead we should always love the process and not only the end goal, because sometimes the end may never come.
