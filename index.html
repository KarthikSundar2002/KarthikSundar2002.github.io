    I am Karthik, the creator of this site and author of this blog. I am happy that you are here.
    This blog is a record of all the experiments I conduct to improve myself. I hope you find them useful.
    </p>

    <p class="HomePageContent">
      In each post, I start out with the goal of the experiment, followed by the story of the experiment.
      Occasionally, I may post my current thoughts on the topic as a hypothesis, which may turn out to be true or false.
      Whatever the end result may be, the experiment or the trial is what counts. As in every science experiment, colloboration is
      important here. Thus, it is alright if you want to disagree with my conclusion, but if you do so then please
      put forth your arguement in the comment section. Therefore, there can be further optimization. I expect all the discussions to be civil and
      if you want to know more about me, please look in the "About Me" section. If you want to contact me, you can check the footer. You can start by
      going to the "Introduction" page in "My Experiments" dropdown. I promise to do my best to give you the value for your time. Enjoy
